## project overview

After the pandemic, I began to have more contact with the parents of my children. We share parenting experiences, take our children out to play on weekends, celebrate traditional Chinese festivals together, and participate in school volunteer activities. When facing difficulties, we help each other. They gave me a sense of belonging in this new place. Therefore, I merged parts of two poems about friendship and named them "From Shadows to Sunshine" to express their support for me.

## technical overview

In order to present the pages as if reading poetry, I used a lot of animations to fade in and out with text and background. The verb of each poem is a hyperlink, distinguished by another color and with a hover effect. Specially created animations of rain and hover font jumping for a few sentences, as well as transform of font scale from large to small. At the end, a rotation was made to enlarge the star to indicate the conclusion.

The programming languages used include HTML and CSS. Using the software Visual Studio Code, and the hosting platform is GitHub.
